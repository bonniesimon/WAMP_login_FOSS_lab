# WAMP_login_FOSS_lab
I hate FOSS labðŸ˜–, seriously, worst lab ever!!


- Install WAMP server 
- go to C:\wamp64\www (assuming you installed in default directory) and create a folder
- Inside this folder, download the files of this repo into it.
- Start WAMP server and go to localhost/phpmyadmin
- Create a sql database and also a table within it with fields `id, username, password`
- In login.php, replace database name and table name with your own
- then go to localhost/DIRECTORY_NAME/login.php (replace DIRECTORY_NAME with the name of the folder you created in step 2)
